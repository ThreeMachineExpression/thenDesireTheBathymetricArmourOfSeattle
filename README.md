# THEN DESIRE THE BATHYMETRIC ARMOUR OF SEATTLE
A response to Tristan Tzara's ["To Make a Dadaist Poem"](https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/tzara.html), or perhaps an implementation of it.

For Allison Parrish's Jan 2021 Creative Writing with Computation and Machine Learning class.

# Artifacts
I wanted to use the internet as the input into Tzara's algorithm, but it is too big.

So I simulated a representative sample of it - [details on the text generation here.](https://github.com/ThreeMachineExpression/subsamplingInternetEnglish/)

Here's what the sample looks like:

I then cut this text up into words and physically randomized them:

(Here I've deviated from Tzara's instructions by cutting and pasting instead of copying. My handwriting isn't great.)

# Observations
There are hidden biases in Tzara's algorithm: longer words are more likely to be selected earlier in the poem, because larger slips of paper are more likely to be chosen by the poet. The physical randomization isn't redundant to the randomization involved in generating the sample.

Because of this, and perhaps because of chance, and perhaps because the colorization didn't cause anything particularly eventful in the final product, I find the intermediate artifact more appealing than the final product.
